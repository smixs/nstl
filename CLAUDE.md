## Project Overview

This is a strategic marketing project for Nestle Uzbekistan focusing on developing a comprehensive SMM (Social Media Marketing) strategy for 2025. The project centers around the launch of NAN® OPTIPRO® 5HMO and strengthening the Nestle Baby & Me ecosystem.

## Key Project Constraints & Compliance

### WHO Code Compliance (CRITICAL)

- **NEVER** propose or create content that promotes infant formula for children under 12 months (stages 1-2)
- **ONLY** promote toddler milk (stages 3-4) and complementary foods
- All strategies must strictly adhere to WHO International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes
- This is non-negotiable and violations lead to immediate project termination

### Brand Guidelines

- Product brands (NAN, NESTOGEN, GERBER, Nestle) must always be integrated with the service brand Nestle Baby & Me
- NAN = "what" (product), Baby & Me = "how" and "why" (support, care, parenting context)
- Never consider product brands in isolation

## Target Audiences

### 1. Striving Researchers (~1.2M)

- Profile: "Mama Sitora" - Deep researcher, analyzes ingredients, reads studies
- Driver: Logic, facts, science, evidence
- Messaging: NAN as scientifically proven and safe choice

### 2. Uncompromising Pioneers (~2.6M)

- Profile: "Mama Shahlo" - Seeks the best, newest, and most advanced
- Driver: Innovation, premium quality, trends
- Messaging: NAN as most innovative and trendy brand (5HMO, goat milk variants)

## Core Business Challenge

**Main Problem**: Low engagement rate (ER) and lifetime value (LTV) despite high follower count
**Success Metrics**:

- Post saves (utility indicator)
- Direct message questions (trust indicator)
- NOT vanity metrics like likes or follower count

## Strategic Framework

When developing strategies, follow this 5-step process:

1. **Find the Tension**: Identify key conflict (e.g., Nestle's thoroughness vs competitors' agility)
2. **Formulate Core Insight**: Deep truth about target audience at intersection of needs and brand capabilities
3. **Define Big Idea**: Central creative platform unifying all communications
4. **Develop Creative Territories**: 2-3 specific content directions
5. **Generate Tactical Examples**: Specific formats and mechanics that increase saves and DM questions

## Influencer Philosophy

### What NOT to do:

- Direct advertising ("Buy NAN, it's the best")
- One-time integrations

### New Approach:

1. **Education through influencers** - Channel for enlightenment, not advertising
2. **Long-term ambassadorship** (1-1.5 years)
3. **Journey Map**:
   - Stage 1: Unbranded education
   - Stage 2: Personal story
   - Stage 3: Native product integration
4. **HCP Influencers**: ONLY unbranded content, never mention NAN brand

## Content Strategy Guidelines

- Focus on solving engagement problem, not creating surface-level creative
- Every idea must answer: "Why would a mother save this post or write us in DM?"
- Prioritize educational and utility-driven content
- Balance product communication with Baby & Me service brand messaging
- Create UGC-style authentic content within corporate constraints

## Competitive Landscape

Key competitors: Nutrilak, Kabrita, Frutonyanya, Agusha

- Competitors are faster and more flexible
- They actively use influencers and UGC
- Some violate WHO code (we will NOT follow this approach)
- Our advantage: scientific heritage, premium positioning, trust

## 2025 Focus: NAN OPTIPRO 5HMO Launch

- Transition from 2 HMO to 5 oligosaccharides
- Supported by "Blink of an Eye" 360° campaign
- All communications must integrate with Nestle Baby & Me ecosystem

## Key Deliverables

When creating strategies or content:

1. Context and objectives alignment
2. Audience insights application
3. Competitive analysis and counter-strategy
4. Brand synergy (NAN + Baby & Me)
5. Content strategy with engagement mechanics
6. Platform strategy (Instagram primary, consider Telegram)
7. Influencer integration scenarios
8. Media and promotion approach
9. Specific KPIs focused on ER and LTV

## Language & Tone

- All content in Russian language
- Educational and supportive tone
- Expert positioning without being preachy
- Empathetic to parents' concerns
- Scientific credibility with accessibility

## Process Notes

- Nestle has longer approval processes due to corporate structure
- Strategy must work within these operational constraints
- Transform "slowness" into "thoroughness and trust"
- Agency partnership should be proactive and reduce operational burden

### Best Practices:

- Always use MCP tools for up-to-date information rather than relying on training data
- Combine multiple tools for comprehensive research
- Use deep research for complex strategic questions
- Verify findings across multiple sources
- Save important findings in project documentation
